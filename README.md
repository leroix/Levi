Levi helps you keep everything in order. If you have many services running that share common settings, Levi can help you keep those settings sync'd up. Levi is platform agnostic but provides some builtin methods for pushing settings to common platforms like dotCloud and Heroku. Adding a new push method is as easy as writing a script in any language and referencing it in the configuration file.

1. Create a file called config.py in the top-level directory using sample_config.py as a template.
2. Type `./levi.py help` to view the commands that Levi accepts. Just try not to get on his bad side.
